# Khaydarin Neuralisk

**Khaydarin Neuralisk** is a project that I am undertaking to develop a budget-friendly EEG device that can be constructed by home enthusiasts. The project is inspired by the Protoss, who use the powerful Khaydarin crystal in their technology, and the Zerg, a race of insectoid creatures in the Starcraft universe.

Influenced by OpenBCI, OpenEEG, and Unicorn Brain Interface, my goal is to provide a high-quality, open-source design for an EEG device that can be created through a variety of manufacturing methods, including 3D printing and PCB printing services. By using easily available components and materials, I aim to make EEG technology accessible to a wider audience of hobbyists and researchers.

The Khaydarin Neuralisk project is committed to open-source principles, and will fall under the MIT License. I encourage contributions from the community in order to improve the design and functionality of the device. Whether you are an experienced engineer or a novice hobbyist, I welcome your input and support in advancing my goal of making EEG technology more accessible and affordable for all.

Thank you for your interest in the Khaydarin Neuralisk project. I look forward to collaborating with you on this exciting venture!
