# Psionic-void-dev

**Psionic-void-dev** is a repository for a collection of personal projects I am working on, spanning various topics that interest me. These topics include machine learning, deep learning, AI, school projects, HomeLab and home networking, self-hosted projects, encryption, automation, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, neural research, and more.

My aim with this repository is to share my work and knowledge with others interested in these topics and contribute to the open-source community. I am committed to the principles of open-source software and encourage others to use and contribute to my work.

Most of the projects in this repository are released under the MIT license, and I encourage others to use and contribute to my work. I am open to feedback and collaboration from anyone interested in these projects. I hope it can be a learning journey for both myself and others passionate about these topics.

It's important to note that I am not an expert in these fields and that these projects are primarily for my learning and growth. I welcome feedback and constructive criticism and am always eager to learn from others with more experience and expertise.

Here are some of the projects that I am currently working on and that you can find in this repository:

- Machine learning and deep learning projects, including image and speech recognition and natural language processing.
- School projects related to computer science and data science.
- Various HomeLab and networking projects.
- Encryption and security projects using encryption cards.
- Automation using  Arduinos and Raspberry Pis for building smart devices and systems.
- Neural research projects, including EEG development and brain-computer interfaces.
  
Thank you for your interest in Psionic-void-dev, and I look forward to collaborating with you on these exciting projects!
