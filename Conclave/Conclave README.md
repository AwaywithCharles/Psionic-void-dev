# Conclave

**Conclave** is a repository for documenting my school work and learning projects from various certifications or self-study. The projects in this repository are primarily for my personal learning and growth, and are not intended for collaboration or contributions from others.

Here are some of the learning projects that you can find in this repository:

- Projects related to my school work in various courses and disciplines, such as computer science, data science, and more.
- Self-study projects related to topics that interest me, such as machine learning, deep learning, and AI.
- Certification projects from courses that I have completed, such as AWS or Microsoft Azure certifications.

Thank you for your interest in Conclave, and I hope that you find these projects informative and helpful in your own learning journey. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.
